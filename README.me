Smart Food Donation Management System, is a web-based platform that connects food donors with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to ensure excess food is delivered to those in need.
The application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and PHP with MySQL for backend operations and data storage. It allows three types of users:
1.	Donors – Individuals or restaurants can register, log in, and submit food donation details.
2.	NGOs – Registered NGOs can view available food donations, accept or reject them based on feasibility, and manage received donations.
3.	Admins – System administrators can monitor donors, NGOs, and all food donation records to ensure smooth and ethical functioning.
The system provides:
•	Registration and login functionality with session management.
•	Dashboards for each user type to manage their activities.
•	Donation history tracking.
•	Status updates of donations (pending, accepted, rejected).
•	Admin control panel to view and manage users and donations.
This project emphasizes social impact through technology, enabling a transparent, traceable, and streamlined process for food redistribution.
